# Repository File Structure

This document is a contributor reference for the repository layout. For user-facing installation and workflow onboarding, start with `README.md`.

## Top level

- `.claude-plugin/`: Claude Code plugin manifest for the repository root
- `skills/`: installable or shareable skill packages
- `plugins/`: plugin packages for external install surfaces
- `docs/`: repository docs, design docs, planning artifacts, and repo-local pressure tests
- `package.json`: minimal repo tooling managed with `pnpm`
- `commitlint.config.js`: commit message rules
- `.husky/`: git hooks, including `commit-msg`

## Skills

Each skill should live in its own directory under `skills/`.

Example:

```text
skills/
  superteam/
    SKILL.md
    agent-spawn-template.md
    pr-body-template.md
    agents/
      openai.yaml
```

- `SKILL.md`: the main skill contract, workflow, and routing rules
- `agent-spawn-template.md`: teammate-based delegation guidance that tells spawned teammates to discover repo rules before edits and follow the correct ownership contract
- `pr-body-template.md`: finish-owned PR reporting template for publish-state follow-through, branch and PR reporting, and external feedback handling
- `agents/openai.yaml`: skill UI metadata used when packaging the skill into a plugin

Keep skill directories self-contained. Prefer adjacent support files over hidden, tool-specific wrappers unless a runtime requires them.

## Plugins

The repository supports two plugin surfaces.

Claude Code loads the repository root through `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which makes the repository root the Claude Code plugin surface and points at the source skills in `./skills`.

Codex consumes the packaged plugin under `plugins/superteam/`.

Example:

```text
.claude-plugin/
  plugin.json
plugins/
  superteam/
    .codex-plugin/
      plugin.json
    skills/
      superteam/
        SKILL.md
        agent-spawn-template.md
        pr-body-template.md
        agents/
          openai.yaml
```

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Claude Code manifest for the repository root
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: packaged plugin manifest and UI metadata
- `plugins/superteam/skills/`: packaged skills exposed by the Codex plugin
- `agents/openai.yaml`: optional skill UI metadata for Codex lists and chips

Treat `plugins/superteam/` as the packaged Codex plugin surface in this repository, and `skills/superteam/` as the authoring source. Refresh the packaged copy with `pnpm sync:plugin`.

## Docs

Use `docs/` for durable repository documentation and implementation artifacts.

Example:

```text
docs/
  file-structure.md
  superpowers/
    pressure-tests/
      superteam-orchestration-contract.md
    specs/
      2026-04-22-8-harden-superteam-orchestration-contracts-and-stage-gates-design.md
    plans/
      2026-04-22-5-claude-plugin-support-able-to-be-imported-to-marketplace-plan.md
```

- `docs/file-structure.md`: contributor-facing layout guide
- `docs/superpowers/specs/`: design documents created during brainstorming
- `docs/superpowers/plans/`: implementation plans created after design approval
- `docs/superpowers/pressure-tests/`: repo-local orchestration pressure tests that document expected halt and reroute behavior
- `docs/superpowers/pressure-tests/superteam-orchestration-contract.md`: the current pressure-test doc for teammate contracts, approval gates, review routing, and shutdown checks

## Contributor expectation

When adding a new skill, mirror the `skills/superteam/` pattern. When making that skill importable as a Codex plugin, package it under `plugins/<name>/` with a plugin manifest and keep the packaged skill self-contained.
