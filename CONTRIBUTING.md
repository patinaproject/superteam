# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to `superteam`. Start here for repo rules; everything else lives in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs dev tooling and registers the Husky hooks (`commit-msg` + `pre-commit`).

## Commit messages

Commits must follow Conventional Commits with no scope and a required GitHub issue tag:

```text
type: #123 short description
```

Examples:

- `feat: #42 add a feature`
- `docs: #17 clarify install steps`

The `commit-msg` hook enforces this. PR titles follow the same format so the squash commit can be reused verbatim.

## Markdown

All Markdown is linted with `markdownlint-cli2`. The `pre-commit` hook runs it on staged files. To lint the whole repo:

```bash
pnpm lint:md
```

## Pull requests

- Keep the PR title in commitlint format.
- Fill in the [PR template](./.github/pull_request_template.md).
- Include an `Acceptance Criteria` section when the linked issue defines ACs.
