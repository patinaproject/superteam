# Releasing

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and Conventional Commits. No manual version bumps, no local release commands.

## How it works

The `Release` workflow runs on every push to `main`. There is no separate UI-triggered release path. Cutting a release is the natural by-product of merging PRs:

1. **Merge any PR into `main`.** The push event runs `Release`. `release-please` scans Conventional Commits since the last tag and opens, or updates, a standing **"chore: release X.Y.Z"** PR that:

   - Bumps `package.json` version.
   - Syncs `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` to the new version (configured in `release-please-config.json`).
   - Appends generated entries to `CHANGELOG.md`.

   Release-please attaches the `autorelease: pending` label to this PR. If there are no releasable commits since the last tag, the run no-ops.

2. **Merge the release PR.** Squash-merging the PR is itself a push to `main`, so `Release` runs again. release-please now sees the merged release PR (still labeled `autorelease: pending`), creates the tag `vX.Y.Z`, publishes the GitHub Release with the Conventional-Commit-derived notes, and dispatches the marketplace bump on `patinaproject/skills`. The PR's label flips to `autorelease: tagged`.

The result: every merge keeps the standing release PR fresh; merging that PR cuts the release. No `gh workflow run` step is required.

## Prerequisites (one-time settings)

### Workflow permissions: read and write

`release-please` writes to the repo — it creates tags, publishes GitHub Releases via `POST /repos/.../releases`, relabels the release PR (`autorelease: pending` → `autorelease: tagged`), and comments on issues referenced in the changelog. The full canonical [permissions set from the release-please-action README](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action#workflow-permissions) is three scopes:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

`issues: write` is easy to miss — PR labels live on the Issues API, so relabeling the release PR needs it even though the target is a PR. Omitting any of the three causes `release-please-action` to fail with `Resource not accessible by integration` on the release step, regardless of how `contents: write` is declared elsewhere. The repo-level default of `read` additionally caps the workflow-level declarations, so both the repo toggle and the workflow YAML must agree.

Enable the read + write default:

- **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write permissions** (save).

Verify from the CLI:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/permissions/workflow \
  --jq .default_workflow_permissions
```

Expected output: `write`. If it prints `read`, the toggle did not stick (see "Recognizing an org-policy cap" below).

### Allow Actions to create and approve pull requests

`release-please` opens its standing release PR using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`. This requires:

- **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**.

Without it, the workflow fails with `GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests.`

### Recognizing an org-policy cap

If either of the two checkboxes above is greyed out, or if the `gh api` verification above still returns `read` after you saved the UI toggle, the setting is being overridden by an organization-level policy. Org-level `Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions` takes precedence over repo-level defaults: when the org policy caps repo defaults at `read`, no repo-level change will take effect. For repos under `patinaproject`, enable the org-level toggle at **organization Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**. Otherwise, escalate to an org admin or fall back to a PAT/App token (next section).

### PAT / GitHub App token fallback

Use this path when org policy caps repo-level workflow permissions below read + write, and raising the org policy is not possible.

Required token scopes:

- `contents: write` — to create tags and publish releases.
- `issues: write` — to relabel the release PR (PR labels are on the Issues API) and to comment on issues referenced in the changelog.
- `pull-requests: write` — to open and update the standing release PR.

A fine-grained PAT or a GitHub App installation token both work. Store it as an **org-level secret** (preferred, so every plugin repo inherits it) or a **repo-level secret**. Suggested name: `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`.

Wire it into `.github/workflows/release.yml` by replacing the `token:` input on the `release-please-action` step:

```yaml
# Before (default path, works when repo/org allows read + write):
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
# After (fallback when org policy caps the default):
          token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN }}
```

The default code path stays `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` in the emitted template so forks outside Patina don't need to provision a Patina-specific secret.

### Tag ruleset caution

`release-please-action` creates **unsigned** tags. It has no signing path. If a repository or organization adds a tag-scoped ruleset that requires signatures on release tags, the release step will fail the moment release-please tries to push `vX.Y.Z`.

If signature enforcement is desired:

- Scope the signature rule to **branches only** (most common).
- Or scope to specific **non-release tag refs** (e.g. a pattern that excludes `v*`).

Verify no release-tag-scoped signature rule is in place:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rulesets \
  --jq '.[] | select(.target=="tag")'
```

### Require SHA-pinned actions

Also recommended (defense-in-depth, aligns with the SHA-pin convention in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)):

- **Settings → Actions → General → Require actions to be pinned to a full-length commit SHA** (available at repo or org level).

When enabled, GitHub refuses to run workflows that `uses:` an action by tag or branch.

## Semver decision

Determined from commit types — no human choice:

- `fix:` → patch
- `feat:` → minor
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → major

## Keeping versions aligned between releases

`package.json` is the canonical source. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` are kept in lockstep.

- `scripts/check-plugin-versions.mjs` is run by the husky `pre-commit` hook and by CI, blocking drift.
- `scripts/sync-plugin-versions.mjs` force-rewrites the plugin manifests from `package.json` if needed.

`CHANGELOG.md` is owned by release-please. Do not hand-edit released sections.

`CHANGELOG.md` is excluded from `pnpm lint:md` (see the `#CHANGELOG.md` glob in `package.json`). release-please emits double blank lines between sections, which violates `MD012/no-multiple-blanks`, and its generator has no knob to change that. Fighting the generator is not worth the churn — the released sections are machine-written and not meant to be hand-edited, so linting them adds no value.

## Distribution via `patinaproject/skills`

When a release is published **and the repository owner is `patinaproject`**, the release workflow automatically dispatches `plugin-release-bump.yml` on `patinaproject/skills`. That marketplace repo opens (or updates) a PR bumping this plugin's pinned `ref` across every Patina marketplace manifest.

No per-repo opt-in is required — the `github.repository_owner == 'patinaproject'` check on the `notify-patinaproject-skills` job gates this behavior. Forks in other orgs skip the job entirely and don't need any of the setup below.

Prerequisites (org-level, one-time, already configured for `patinaproject`):

- A GitHub App owned by `patinaproject` named `patina-project-automation`, with **Actions: Read and write** permission, installed on `patinaproject/skills` only.
- Two org secrets exposing the App's identity to every plugin repo:
  - `PATINAPROJECT_AUTOMATION_APP_ID` — the App ID (small integer, not sensitive).
  - `PATINAPROJECT_AUTOMATION_PRIVATE_KEY` — the App's private key (PEM-encoded; sensitive).

The release workflow uses [`actions/create-github-app-token`](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) to mint a per-job installation token from the App credentials, then passes that token to `benc-uk/workflow-dispatch` to fire `plugin-release-bump.yml` on `patinaproject/skills`.

Why an org-owned App rather than a personal access token: the App identity isn't tied to any individual user, survives organizational turnover, surfaces as `patina-project-automation[bot]` in audit logs, and scopes its capabilities to one repo with one permission. Rotation is "regenerate App key", not "regenerate user PAT."

If either secret is missing on a `patinaproject` plugin repo, the `Mint patina-project-automation App token` step will fail and the `notify-patinaproject-skills` job will surface that failure on the run page. The release itself (the `release-please` job) still completes regardless. To unblock, ensure both org secrets are set; or fire the marketplace bump manually with `gh workflow run plugin-release-bump.yml --repo patinaproject/skills -f plugin=<repo> -f tag=<tag>`.

## Writing commits for a clean changelog

- Use Conventional Commits: `feat: #<issue> …`, `fix: #<issue> …`, etc.
- Breaking changes: prefix the type with `!` (e.g. `feat!: #123 rename foo to bar`) **and** include a `BREAKING CHANGE: …` footer in the PR body.
- Squash-merge flow: PR titles must themselves be conventional-commit-shaped so the squash commit lands with the correct type/scope. Enforced by the `Lint PR` workflow.
