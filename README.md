# Superteam

Build with a team of agents using Superpowers.

`superteam` is a Claude Code + Codex plugin. It ships an installable orchestration skill under `skills/superteam/` and is distributed through the [`patinaproject/skills`](https://github.com/patinaproject/skills) marketplace.

Spend less time managing implementation loops and babysitting CI. Superteam builds on Superpowers to get you to a real, demoable, testable artifact as quickly as possible, with enough structure to review it, iterate on it, and keep moving.

## What this plugin does

Superteam takes one GitHub issue and routes it through a structured teammate workflow — `Team Lead`, `Brainstormer`, `Planner`, `Executor`, `Reviewer`, `Finisher` — so the next agent, subagent, or human can continue from durable artifacts (design doc, plan doc, branch, PR) instead of chat history alone.

```

The workflow stays portable across agent teams and direct subagent handoffs because it is organized around teammate ownership, repo-owned artifacts, and explicit gates rather than one host runtime's mechanics.

## What happens at each stage

- `Team Lead`: reads the issue, discovers repo rules, decides which teammate should act next, and halts the run when a gate is not satisfied.
- `Brainstormer`: turns the issue into a design doc, captures the active acceptance criteria, and asks for explicit approval before planning starts.
- `Planner`: converts the approved design into an implementation plan with concrete tasks.
- `Executor`: implements only the approved plan, including tests and verification evidence. Does not push branches or open PRs.
- `Reviewer`: performs local pre-publish review, classifies findings as implementation-, plan-, or spec-level, and pressure-tests skill/workflow changes before publish.
- `Finisher`: pushes, opens or updates the PR, monitors CI and mergeability, interprets external PR feedback, and keeps the run alive until the published branch state is stable.

A run is only complete when the published branch state is stable enough to hand off cleanly or an explicit blocker is reported.

## Agent roster

| Teammate | Owns | Recommended `superpowers` skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Team Lead | Orchestration, delegation, gates, and loopbacks | `superpowers:using-superpowers`; `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` when splitting independent work |
| Brainstormer | Design doc creation and approval handoff | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Planner | Approved implementation plan creation | `superpowers:writing-plans` |
| Executor | ATDD-driven implementation, code, and tests for the approved plan | `superpowers:test-driven-development`; `superpowers:systematic-debugging`; `superpowers:verification-before-completion`; `superpowers:writing-skills` when editing `skills/**/*.md` |
| Reviewer | Local pre-publish review intake, finding classification, loopback routing | `superpowers:requesting-code-review`; `superpowers:receiving-code-review`; `superpowers:writing-skills` when reviewing `skills/**/*.md` |
| Finisher | Publish-state follow-through, branch/PR/CI reporting, external post-publish review feedback | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`; `superpowers:receiving-code-review` |

## Installation

`superteam` ships as a Claude Code + Codex plugin. Other supported editors read the repository-level files this plugin emits (`AGENTS.md`, `.cursor/`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) directly. Install Superpowers first by following the setup instructions in [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).

### Claude Code

1. Register the Patina Project marketplace:

   ```text
   /plugin marketplace add patinaproject/skills
   ```

2. Install the plugin:

   ```text
   /plugin install superteam@patinaproject-skills
   ```

3. Open the relevant GitHub issue in your Claude Code session, then invoke:

   ```text
   /superteam:superteam
   ```

#### Optional: Enable Agent Teams

If you want Claude Code to use Agent Teams for this workflow, enable Agent Teams in your Claude configuration before invoking Superteam. Add `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` to the `env` block in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-wide) or `.claude/settings.json` (project-specific):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Agent Teams is optional. If you do not enable it, Superteam still works with the regular single-agent or subagent flow. When using Agent Teams, prefer them for bounded, independent teammate work; keep highly interactive or clarification-heavy steps in the foreground.

### OpenAI Codex CLI

1. Register the Patina Project marketplace:

   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add patinaproject/skills
   ```

2. Install the plugin:

   ```bash
   codex plugin marketplace add patinaproject/superteam
   ```

3. Invoke from the target repository:

   ```text
   Use $superteam to route this issue through teammate-owned design, planning, execution, review, and Finisher-owned publish follow-through.
   ```

### OpenAI Codex App

1. Install or enable the `superteam` plugin from your Codex plugin source.
2. Open the target repository in the app.
3. Invoke:

   ```text
   Use $superteam to route this issue through teammate-owned design, planning, execution, review, and Finisher-owned publish follow-through.
   ```

When `Finisher` is waiting on external publish-state in the Codex app, prefer a thread automation attached to the current thread so follow-through stays in the same conversation context.

### GitHub Copilot

No plugin install required. This repo ships `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, which Copilot Chat reads automatically when the repo is open in your editor.

```text
@workspace Use the superteam skill for the workflow described above.
```

### Cursor

No plugin install required. This repo ships `.cursor/rules/superteam.mdc`, which Cursor loads as a project rule whenever the repo is open. Ask the Cursor agent to apply `superteam`.

### Windsurf

No plugin install required. This repo ships `.windsurfrules`, which Windsurf reads natively when the repo is open. Ask Cascade to apply `superteam`.

### Aider, Zed, Cline, Opencode

No plugin install required. These tools read `AGENTS.md` natively. Open the repo and ask the assistant to apply the `superteam` workflow described in `AGENTS.md`.

## Usage

```text
/superteam:superteam work on issue 16
/superteam:superteam new requirement: make it more super
/superteam:superteam resume from review
```

Superteam keeps the workflow grounded in explicit teammate ownership, written design and plan artifacts, verification before completion, and finish-owned review follow-through. You can invoke Superteam at any point in the lifecycle and have it resume from the right teammate instead of starting over.

## Development

This repository is the source for the plugin. Local workflow:

```bash
pnpm install           # installs dev deps and wires husky
pnpm lint:md           # markdownlint-cli2
pnpm check:versions    # enforce package.json ↔ plugin manifests lockstep
pnpm commitlint        # one-off commit-message validation
```
