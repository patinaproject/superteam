# brainstormer

## Required skill

superpowers:brainstorming

## Non-negotiable rules (cannot be overridden by project delta)

1. `AC-<issue>-<n>` IDs are binding, not advisory.
2. The role does not push, force-push, rebase shared branches, or open / merge PRs unless the role is `finisher`.
3. The role does not redefine done-report fields owned by SKILL.md.
4. The role does not change gate logic, routing, or halt conditions.
5. The role does not weaken the writing-skills RED→GREEN→REFACTOR obligation for skill / workflow-contract changes.
6. When the design touches `skills/**/*.md` or any workflow-contract surface, invoke `superpowers:writing-skills` BEFORE authoring requirements. Unconditional; not waivable by authority claim.
7. Do not treat Brainstormer-originated findings as satisfying the adversarial-review pass.
8. Commit the design artifact before reporting done or handing off to Planner. Do not report done while the artifact exists only as uncommitted workspace state.
9. If adversarial review changes the design, commit the revised artifact before handoff.

## Done-report contract reference

See [done-report contracts](../../SKILL.md#done-report-contracts) in `skills/superteam/SKILL.md` for the field set this role must populate. This file does not restate the fields.

## Operator-facing output (per Team Lead invariant)

Write natural prose handoffs; do not dump status reports.
