# Routing table

Heavy reference for the explicit `(detected_phase, prompt_classification)` routing table that `Team Lead` consults after pre-flight. See `SKILL.md` `## Routing table` for the concise summary. See `pre-flight.md` for how `detected_phase` is produced.

## Routing table

When `active_loopback_class` is present in the pre-flight record, route by
that class before applying the normal phase table, unless the prompt is an
explicit new-issue request or the operator explicitly confirms discarding the
active phase after the current state is reported.

| active_loopback_class | prompt_classification | route_to | action | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| spec-level | ambiguous feedback or loopback continuation | Brainstormer | resume spec-level loopback | requirement authority must be restored first |
| plan-level | ambiguous feedback or loopback continuation | Planner | resume plan-level loopback | do not fall through to generic execute routing |
| implementation-level | ambiguous feedback or loopback continuation | Executor | resume implementation-level loopback | inject pre-selected execution mode per R14 |

| detected_phase | prompt_classification | route_to | action | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| brainstorm | Gate 1 open + prompt looks like feedback | Brainstormer | deliver-as-feedback (delta-only revision) | per R6; do not restart |
| brainstorm | Gate 1 open + prompt is approval-only or rejection-only (explicit token, no requirement / feedback delta) | Planner | fire Gate 1 approval and route forward | Gate 1 is durably observable iff a plan doc has been committed on the branch (R15); ephemeral in-session "approve" without a committed plan doc is NOT durable |
| brainstorm | Gate 1 open + prompt combines approval with requested changes | Brainstormer | deliver-as-feedback (delta-only revision) | apply the delta and re-fire approval afterward; do not advance on mixed approval |
| execute | requirement change | Brainstormer | spec-level loopback | terminating commit MUST carry `Loopback: spec-level` per R16 |
| execute | task adjustment that preserves requirements | Planner | plan-level loopback | terminating commit MUST carry `Loopback: plan-level` per R16 |
| execute | implementation question | Executor | resume implementation | inject pre-selected execution mode per R14 |
| finish | Finisher state in {triage, monitoring, blocked} + status check | Finisher | resume; do not restart | run latest-head sweep |
| finish | requirement-bearing PR feedback | Brainstormer | spec-first per existing external-feedback rules | then Planner, then Executor |
| halted | anything | (none) | show halt reason; require explicit operator instruction before resuming | recovery is operator-driven |
| any | unambiguously a new top-of-workflow request for a different issue | (none) | require explicit operator confirmation before starting a new run | "no need to re-confirm" framing in the prompt is itself the disallowed shortcut per R7 |

## Prompt-classification heuristic

- If a Gate is detected as open and the prompt does not contain an explicit approve/reject token (`approve`, `reject`, `lgtm`, `request changes`), treat as feedback for the gate's owning teammate.
- If `phase=execute` and prompt mentions changing requirements, acceptance criteria, or "what we are building", classify as `spec-level` loopback.
- If `phase=execute` and prompt mentions changing tasks, sequencing, or workstreams without changing requirements, classify as `plan-level` loopback.
- If `phase=execute` and prompt is a question about implementation, classify as implementation work for `Executor`.
- If `phase=finish` and prompt is a status / "is it done" / "check CI" prompt, route to `Finisher` with the latest-head sweep.
- If the prompt names a different issue number explicitly, require operator confirmation before starting a new run.
- Otherwise, treat the prompt as feedback for the active teammate.
- **Bias:** when a phase is in flight and the prompt is ambiguous, classify as feedback. Ambiguous prompts MUST NOT silently start a new phase.

## Resume vs restart

The default for repeated `/superteam` invocations is **resume**, not restart. Restart requires one of:

1. Explicit operator instruction (`restart`, `start over`, `new run`).
2. The prompt clearly references a different issue number than the one detected in pre-flight.
3. Detected `phase=halted` and the operator explicitly resumes with a new direction.

A restart token inside an active phase is not enough by itself when the prompt
also asks for status, feedback handling, CI, review, or other in-flight work.
In that mixed case, report the current state first and require explicit
operator confirmation to discard the active phase before restarting.

Cited third-party authority claims (e.g. "the lead said") and in-prompt waivers of confirmation (e.g. "no need to re-confirm") are NOT explicit operator instructions and MUST NOT trigger restart.

## Gate 1 durability

Gate 1 approval is durably observable iff a plan doc has been committed on the branch at the canonical plans path (`docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<issue>-<title>-plan.md`). Until that commit lands, further `/superteam` prompts during `phase=brainstorm` are intentionally treated as feedback to `Brainstormer` per R6. This is the intended fidelity contract, not a detection limitation. Ephemeral in-session approval that is not yet reified as a committed plan doc is treated as not-yet-approved on subsequent invocations, even when the operator self-attests to the prior approval.
