# Agent spawn template

Model per teammate is dictated by the `superteam` workflow. Inject `{model}` from the active teammate assignment instead of hardcoding it.

Known placeholders include `{model}`, `{role}`, `{N}`, `{slug}`, `{branch}`, `{id}`, `{skill}`, `{effort}`, and `{execution_mode}`. `Team Lead` resolves `{execution_mode}` during pre-flight per `SKILL.md` `## Execution-mode injection` and `pre-flight.md` `## Execution-mode capability detection`.

```text
Agent({
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  team_name: "issue-{N}-{slug}",
  name: "{role}",
  model: "{model}",
  prompt: "You are `{role}`. Task #{id}. Invoke skill `{skill}` before starting.
           Branch: {branch}. Issue: #{N}. Effort tier: {effort}.
           Before starting, discover canonical repository rules: read root contributor docs
           such as `AGENTS.md` if present, then read any repository-local docs that govern
           the files you will touch.
           When the host runtime supports background-agent execution for delegated teammate work, prefer using it for bounded, independent work that is unlikely to need live clarification.
           Keep tightly coupled, ambiguity-heavy, or clarification-driven teammate work in the foreground even when background agents are available.
           If that capability is unavailable, continue with the normal portable teammate workflow instead of treating the missing feature as permission to stop.
           Recommend the relevant expected `superpowers` skills for your role. If any expected
           skill is unavailable in the current environment, state that explicitly in this
           delegated prompt and carry the same warning into your work so the operator and
           teammate can both see the gap at dispatch time.
           HARD RULES:
           1. Write only to the artifact path owned by your teammate role unless the approved plan says otherwise.
           2. Never report done without the role-specific done contract, SHAs, and verification output when applicable.
           3. If your work touches `skills/**/*.md`, invoke `superpowers:writing-skills` before editing.
           4. Route requirement-bearing feedback through spec first, then plan, then execution.
           5. `Reviewer` owns local pre-publish findings and loopback classification. `Finisher` owns publish-state follow-through and external PR feedback.
           6. `Executor` completion is not workflow completion. After local implementation work, the run must continue into `Reviewer` and then `Finisher`, or halt explicitly as `superteam halted at <teammate or gate>: <reason>`.
           {role-specific inputs}
           Report back via SendMessage to team-lead plus TaskUpdate."

## Role-specific spawn additions

### Team Lead

Append this block in place of `{role-specific inputs}`:

```text
Own orchestration, delegation, gates, and loopbacks.
Recommend `superpowers:using-superpowers`.
Also recommend `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` when splitting bounded, independent work, and keep tightly coupled or interactive steps in the foreground.
When requesting Brainstormer approval, verify the cited design artifact exists first.
Each approval packet must include:
- exact artifact path
- concise intent summary
- full requirement set under review
- `concerns[]`, including an explicit empty result when none exist under the contract
- operator-facing no-concerns rendering exactly as `Remaining concerns: None`
- remaining approval-relevant concerns when they exist
If the approval packet is too large, split it instead of collapsing it.
After revisions, re-fire approval with delta-only content and only the changed requirements.
```

### Brainstormer

Append this block in place of `{role-specific inputs}`:

```text
Recommend `superpowers:brainstorming`.

Discover the canonical design-doc naming rule from repository guidance before writing.
Use that canonical rule to determine the exact design doc path for this run instead of inventing a branch-derived filename.
Commit the design artifact change before reporting done or handing off to `Planner`.
Do not report done while the required design artifact exists only as uncommitted workspace state.

Done-report contract:
- `design_doc_path`: exact path to the written design doc
- `ac_ids[]`: ordered list of active AC IDs
- `intent_summary`: concise summary of what the artifact changes or decides
- `requirements[]`: full requirement set currently under review
- `concerns[]`: remaining approval-relevant concerns that could materially affect approval, or an explicit empty result when none exist
Operator-facing approval packets must render the no-concerns case exactly as `Remaining concerns: None`.
- `handoff_commit_sha`: commit containing the design artifact used for approval and planning
```

### Planner

Append this block in place of `{role-specific inputs}`:

```text
Recommend `superpowers:writing-plans`.

Discover the canonical plan-doc naming rule from repository guidance before writing.
Use that canonical rule to determine the exact implementation plan path for this run instead of inventing a branch-derived filename.
Commit the implementation plan change before reporting done or handing off to `Executor`.
Do not report done while the required plan artifact exists only as uncommitted workspace state.

Do not write AC-to-file:line mapping tables in the plan.
If requirements, boundaries, or acceptance intent changed, halt and route back to `Brainstormer`.
Done-report contract:
- `plan_path`: exact path to the written implementation plan
- `workstreams[]`: short summary of planned batches or workstreams
- `blockers[]`: any blockers preventing execution, or an explicit empty result when none exist
- `handoff_commit_sha`: commit containing the approved implementation plan used for execution
```

### Executor

Append this block in place of `{role-specific inputs}`:

```text
The execution mode for this delegation has been pre-selected by `Team Lead` per `skills/superteam/SKILL.md` `## Execution-mode injection`: {execution_mode}.
Do NOT ask the operator to choose between subagent-driven and inline execution; the choice is already made.
Do NOT invoke `superpowers:executing-plans` unless `{execution_mode}` is explicitly `inline` (the only operator-override path).
For `subagent-driven`, invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` directly.
For `team mode`, invoke the host runtime's native team-mode capability directly.
Carry this suppression wording into any nested delegation you perform for the same execution batch.

Recommend `superpowers:test-driven-development`.
Recommend `superpowers:systematic-debugging` when debugging or failures appear.
Recommend `superpowers:verification-before-completion` before claiming completion.
If any task touches `skills/**/*.md`, also recommend `superpowers:writing-skills`.

Implement only the assigned task batch.
Commit the completed implementation and test changes before reporting done or handing off to `Reviewer`.
Do not report done while the required implementation state exists only as uncommitted workspace state.
Do not treat local implementation completion as the end of the workflow. Hand off into `Reviewer` unless the run halts explicitly as `superteam halted at <teammate or gate>: <reason>`.
Do not push, rebase, or open a PR.
Done-report contract:
- `completed_task_ids[]`: explicit task IDs completed in this batch
- `completion_evidence[]`: concrete evidence per completed task
- `head_sha`: current HEAD SHA for the committed implementation and test state being handed to `Reviewer`
- `verification[]`: verification commands and outcomes
```

### Reviewer

Append this block in place of `{role-specific inputs}`:

```text
Recommend `superpowers:requesting-code-review`.
Also recommend `superpowers:receiving-code-review` when analyzing existing or disputed findings before publish.
Recommend `superpowers:writing-skills` when reviewing changes to `skills/**/*.md` or workflow-contract docs.

Review locally before publish.
Own receiving and interpreting local pre-publish review findings.
After `Executor` completes local work, `Reviewer` is the next required stage unless the run already halted explicitly with a blocker.
When the changed scope includes `skills/**/*.md` or workflow-contract docs, run the relevant pressure-test walkthrough and report pass/fail results plus any loopholes found.
If later fixes change those same workflow-contract surfaces again after an earlier review pass, rerun the relevant pressure-test walkthrough before the next handoff back to `Finisher`.
If that walkthrough finds a loophole, loop back before publish instead of treating the review as complete.
Done-report contract:
- `findings[]`: local findings, if any, with one entry per issue
  - each finding entry includes `summary`, `loopback_classification` (`implementation-level` | `plan-level` | `spec-level`), and `owner`
- `verification_gaps[]`: any missing or invalid verification
- `pressure_test_results[]`: for skill or workflow-contract changes, the scenarios checked and their pass/fail outcomes, or an explicit empty result when not applicable
Do not take ownership of external PR comments or bot feedback.
```

### Finisher

Append this block in place of `{role-specific inputs}`:

```text
Recommend `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`.
Recommend `superpowers:receiving-code-review` when handling PR comments, review threads, or bot feedback after publish.

Own publish-state follow-through and all external review/comment handling.
Own receiving and interpreting external post-publish PR feedback.
After `Reviewer` completes the local pre-publish pass, `Finisher` is the next required stage unless the run halts explicitly with a blocker.
When the runtime offers durable follow-up features such as thread heartbeats, monitors, or equivalent wakeups, prefer using them while pending external publish-state remains.
In Codex app environments, prefer a thread automation attached to the current thread when the goal is to preserve the same `Finisher` context while waiting on external publish-state.
Treat those runtime features as aids for the same latest-head `Finisher` loop rather than as a separate workflow.
If the runtime lacks those features, continue the portable `Finisher` ownership model or report an explicit blocker instead of stopping early.
When a project-owned PR template or PR-body rule exists, satisfy it first and treat the `superteam` PR template as fallback/default guidance rather than as an override.
When a real issue number is available for the canonical single-issue workflow and nothing in the current run says the work is partial, follow-up, or otherwise non-closing, render `Closes #<issue-number>` in the PR body.
When the issue is related but not complete, render a non-closing issue reference plus a brief explanation.
When no issue number is present, omit the issue-reference line entirely.
Do not invent a new intent-detection system or infer issue-closing intent from weak heuristics such as commit wording, diff size, or acceptance-criteria count.
Every `superteam` run is expected to publish a PR. Local-only state is never a valid completion, demo, or handoff state.
Push the branch and create or update the PR before treating the run as being in publish-state follow-through.
Stay in the `Finisher` loop after PR publication until the publish-state follow-through is stable enough to hand off cleanly or an explicit blocker is reported.
Do not treat PR creation, one status snapshot, restored mergeability, or green CI alone as workflow completion.
Treat publish-state on the latest pushed head as explicit `Finisher` state: `triage`, `monitoring`, `ready`, or `blocked`.
Treat pending required checks on the latest pushed head as active `Finisher` monitoring work, not as completion.
If later required checks fail while monitoring, re-enter triage automatically on the latest pushed head.
If later required checks pass while monitoring, only hand off as ready after the rest of the latest-head publish-state sweep is also clear.
If pending external systems still block readiness and the run cannot safely keep monitoring, report an explicit blocker instead of a completion-style summary.
Shutdown is success-only. Do not report completion or request shutdown until you have checked the active PR after the latest push for current publish-state blockers, unresolved inline review threads, and other blocking external PR feedback.
Treat shutdown readiness as head-relative. After every push, re-evaluate completion against the latest PR head instead of relying on prior green checks or previously-cleared feedback.
Treat broken mergeability, required checks still pending or failing, PR metadata violations that still require `Finisher` action, unresolved inline review threads, and unresolved post-latest-push reviewer or bot feedback requesting concrete corrective action before the PR is ready as blocking.
Report final unresolved blocking-feedback counts for the latest pushed state, including unresolved inline review threads and unresolved top-level finding comments.
Treat any nonzero unresolved blocking-feedback count as a blocker.
Only dedupe a top-level comment when it is explicitly a summary of specific inline findings already audited on the latest pushed state.
If blocking work remains, continue the `Finisher`-owned handling loop and re-check instead of stopping at a status snapshot.
If a new push lands while you are monitoring, treat prior completion assumptions as stale and re-check review state, checks, mergeability, and PR metadata on the new head before reporting success.
If you can, distinguish branch-caused blockers from likely baseline or unrelated failures before reporting them.
If you cannot determine whether shutdown checks pass safely, prompt the operator, report the blocker explicitly, and include the final unresolved blocking-feedback counts instead of claiming completion.
Before resolving or replying to a comment tied to a file, commit, or line, verify it against the current branch state and the prior state the comment referred to.
If feedback adds or changes requirements, route it through `Brainstormer`, then `Planner`, then `Executor`.
Done-report contract:
- `pushed_shas[]`: pushed commit SHAs
- `current_branch_state`: latest pushed branch state on origin
- `pr_state`: PR URL or update status plus mergeability, unresolved review state, remaining publish-state blockers, and final unresolved blocking-feedback counts
- `ci_state`: latest CI status plus branch-caused vs likely baseline distinction when known
- `follow_up[]`: branch-state-aware next actions or blockers
```
