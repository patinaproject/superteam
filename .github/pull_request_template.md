# Pull Request

PR title rule for squash merges: use the exact commitlint/commitizen format for the PR title so the squash commit can be reused unchanged.

`type: #123 short description`

Examples:
- `docs: #12 add superteam skill guide`
- `chore: #34 bootstrap commit hooks`

This title rule applies to pull requests only. GitHub issue titles should stay plain-language and should not use conventional-commit prefixes.
